### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. Feel free to have a look around.

I've been trying to contrbute to open source projects outside of work when I have time but there might not be much to look at right now :(

One of my open source projects is [Issue Status](https://github.com/tadhglewis/issue-status), it's an open source status page built using React and GitHub Issues.
